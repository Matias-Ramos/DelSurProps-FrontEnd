# Project Name
DelSurProps

## About the Project

### Purpose
The client has requested a solution that centralizes the properties they manage: For sale, Rentals, and Entrepreneurships.

### Solution
This is a solution built in React.js, which centralizes the properties on a single website and redirects the client to the link on MercadoLibre/Zonaprop/Argenprop, where they can find more information related to the property of their interest.

### Link
delsurprops.com.ar

### Full stack architecture
This is a full-stack project, designed to work in conjunction with this backend: [https://github.com/Matias-Ramos/Inmobiliaria-backend-go] and with an SQL database:

### **Important** note for developers
If the viewport is modified from a browser (desktop view to mobile view or vice versa), it will be necessary to refresh the page, since there are some components that are not dynamically adaptable. Basically, due to the cost benefit it represented to do that, I decided not to.

### Running the Project
Run "npm run dev" in the IDE terminal. Next, go to the url [http://127.0.0.1:5173/] in the browser.

### Project Initialization
The project was initialized with Vite.
